    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p> A creamy dessert of espresso-soaked ladyfingers surrounded by lightly sweetened whipped cream and a rich mascarpone,<br>
         tiramisu relies heavily on the quality of its ingredients.</p>
         <hr>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>half a cup of grandulated sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 cup or 8 ounces of mascarpone</li>
        <li>1 3/4 cups columbian coffee</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons rum</li>
        <li>1 pack of ladyfingers</li>
        <li>1 to 2 ounces of chocolate shavings(optional)</li>
    
    </ul>
     <hr>
     <h3>Steps</h3>
     <ol>
        <li>Using an electric mixer in a medium bowl, whip together egg yolks and ¼ cup/50 grams <br>
            sugar until very pale yellow and about tripled in volume. A slight ribbon should fall <br>
            from the beaters (or whisk attachment) when lifted from the bowl. Transfer mixture to a<br>
            large bowl, wiping out the medium bowl used to whip the yolks and set aside.</li>
        <li>In the medium bowl, whip cream and remaining ¼ cup/50 grams sugar until it creates soft-medium peaks. <br>
            Add mascarpone and continue to whip until it creates a soft, spreadable mixture with medium peaks.<br>
            Gently fold the mascarpone mixture into the sweetened egg yolks until combined.</li>
        <li>Combine espresso and rum in a shallow bowl and set aside.</li>
        <li>Quickly dip each lady finger into the espresso mixure, be wary of oversoaking each one.<br>
            Place them round side up until each section is complete, then pour your mixture on top of <br>
            each layer until your dish is filled, or you run out of mixture.</li>
        <li>Dust the top layer with your cocoa shavings to top off this amazing dessert.</li>
        <li>Enjoy this teramisu!</li>
