        Cook the chicken for around 20 to 25 minutes. </li>
    <li>Once the chicken is cooked, grab a hand mixer or a fork and slowly shred the chicken. Once the chicken is shredded put it off <br>
        to the side for later.</li>
    <li>In another pot put in the tomatoes and cover with water, bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cook for 8 to 10 minutes. While that <br>
        is cooking slice and prep the onions.</li>
    <li>Place the tomato mixture, garlic, salt, pepper, cumin, cayenne pepper, paparika and the chipotle can into a blender. <br>
        Once blended put the chicken and the blended mixture into a sauce pan on simmer. Cook for 3 to 5 minutes and stir occasionally. </li>
    <li>Now for the final step in the process is cooking your can of refried beans in a small sauce pan on medium heat, add some mozzarella for flavor</li>
<h3>For Serving</h3>   
 <ul>
    <li>1 bag of tostadas</li>
    <li>queso fresco</li>
    <li>crumbling cheese</li>
    <li>Honduran Cream</li>
 </ul>
<h3>Serving Steps</h3>
 <ol>
    <li>Place a toastada on a plate, then put some refried beans on top.</li>
    <li>Next you will add the chicken on the refried beans, as much as you'd like.</li>
